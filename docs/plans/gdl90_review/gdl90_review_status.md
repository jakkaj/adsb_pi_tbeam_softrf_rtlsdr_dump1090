# GDL90 Review Plan - COMPLETED (2025-04-25 ~14:20 PM)

**Plan:** `docs/plans/gdl90_review/gdl90_review_plan.md`

**Overall Status:** All tasks completed successfully ✅

**Completed Tasks:**
*   Phase 1 (Tasks 1.1 - 1.4): Core GDL90 encoding corrections in `modules/gdl90.py` are complete.
*   Phase 2 (Tasks 2.1 - 2.2): Enhanced testing and validation of broadcast output.
*   Phase 3 (Tasks 3.1 - 3.4): Memory Graph Update with entities and relationships.

**Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  Fixed CRC calculation to use the correct CRC-16-CCITT algorithm (Task 1.1).
2.  Corrected Heartbeat timestamp encoding to properly handle little-endian timestamp bytes (Task 1.2).
3.  Verified field encodings in Traffic Report and other messages (Tasks 1.3 & 1.4).
4.  Enhanced test cases in `modules/gdl90.py` using unittest framework (Task 2.1).
5.  Fixed broadcaster pressure altitude spoofing to enable Ownship Reports (Task 2.2).
6.  Corrected heartbeat message decoding in `gdl90_tester.py` to properly handle endianness.
7.  Created dedicated test for heartbeat message encoding/decoding in `test_gdl90_heartbeat.py`.
8.  Verified successful broadcast and reception of all message types (Task 2.2):
    * Heartbeat (ID: 0x00)
    * Ownship Report (ID: 0x0A)
    * Ownship Geo Alt (ID: 0x0B)
9.  Updated Memory Graph with all source files, changes, and relationships (Tasks 3.1-3.4).

**Outcomes Achieved:**
* GDL90 message encoding now complies with specification requirements
* Proper CRC-16-CCITT checksum calculation ensures message integrity
* Heartbeat timestamp format corrects previous encoding issues
* Message decoding in the tester now properly handles field endianness
* All expected message types are successfully transmitted and received
* Comprehensive unit tests provide ongoing validation of encoding/decoding
* Memory Graph updated with complete context of changes and relationships

**Future Considerations:**
* Consider additional integration tests for full message cycle (encoding → transmission → reception → decoding)
* Potentially extend GDL90 implementation to support more optional message types
* May need to review behavior during real GPS acquisition vs. spoofed data
